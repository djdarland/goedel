There are some incompatibilities between versions 1.2 and 1.3. Most of the 
changes are in the meta-modules Syntax and Programs. If you have programs 
in version 1.2 of the system using these modules, you will need to do some 
minor editing to get them running in version 1.3. Here are the changes: 


Syntax and Programs
===================

The symbol names 

OName
OType
OTerm
OFormula
OTypeSubst
OTermSubst
OFunctionInd
OPredicateInd
OVarTyping
OProgram
OModulePart
OCondition

have all had the leading O removed.


Each of the predicates

InsDelAxiom
InsDelDelay
InsDelProgramBase
InsDelProgramConstant
InsDelProgramConstructor
InsDelProgramFunction
InsDelProgramPredicate
InsDelProgramProposition
InsDelStatement

now has a separate Insert and Delete form. 


The predicates in Syntax

ConvBindingToTypeSubst
ConvBindingToTermSubst
ConvBindingToVarTyping

are renamed to

BindingToTypeSubst
BindingToTermSubst
BindingToVarTyping


The predicates in Syntax

RenameAllFormulas
RenameAllTerms
RenameAllTypes

have been deleted.  Instead of these, use the predicates

VariantFormulas
VariantTerms
VariantTypes


The predicates in Syntax

OpaqueBaseType
OpaqueConstructorType
OpaqueConstantTerm
OpaqueFunctionTerm
OpaquePropositionAtom
OpaquePredicateAtom
SymbolName

have been deleted.


The predicates in Programs

NonFlounder
EmptyProgram 

have been deleted.


The predicates in Programs

ProgramTypeToString
ProgramTermToString
ProgramFormulaToString

have had the third and fourth arguments reversed. 


The predicate in Programs 

NewProgram

has had its arguments reversed. 


In Programs

TermInProgram has had its 2nd and 3rd arguments reversed.
TermInModule has had its 4th and 5th arguments reversed.



Strings
=======

The predicate

ListIntAsString

is now called 

StringInts 

and its arguments are reversed. 



Theories
========

Each of the predicates

InsDelTheoryBase
InsDelTheoryConstant
InsDelTheoryConstructor
InsDelTheoryFunction
InsDelTheoryImport
InsDelTheoryPredicate
InsDelTheoryProposition

now has a separate Insert and Delete form


The predicate

NewTheory

has had its arguments reversed. 


The predicates

TheoryTypeToString
TheoryTermToString
TheoryFormulaToString

have had their second and third arguments reversed.
