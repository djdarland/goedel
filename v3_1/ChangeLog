Goedel 1.4 Mon Apr 25 11:30:45 BST 1994
=======================================

New features:

- SAGE (Self-Applicable Goedel partial Evaluator) by Corin Gurr included
- runtime version available for Linux on IBM-PC compatibles
- floundering checker added 
- floundering messages improved 
- Goedel strings are allowed to be arbitrary length, due to an improvement
	in SICStus 2.1 #9.
- new system commands
	;save File Goal. - Save the state into File to be restored to run Goal
	;checking.       - Switch on various checkings (default)
	;nochecking.     - Switch off all the checkings
- system command ';unix {"Command"}' renamed to ';shell {"Command"}'
- interface to Prolog (and thus to C) documented
- 'r-redo' command added to the tracer
- IntegerString/2 in Numbers module implemented
- support for new predicates
	ProgramCompile/2 and ProgramDecompile/1 in ProgramsIO module
	FlockCompile/2 and FlockDecompile/2 in FlocksIO module
- Makefile now aware of SICStus fastcode/compactcode availability 
- Statistics module included (can be found in /lib) which provides timing
	and other system information


Bug fixes in:

- type checking with Numbers
- 's-skip' command in the tracer
- set manipulations
- flock-compile an identifier immediately followed by a full stop, e.g. 'A.'
- LastSubstring("ABC", x, "C")



Goedel 1.3  Jun 18 1993 
=======================

There are some incompatibilities between versions 1.2 and 1.3. Most of the 
changes are in the meta-modules Syntax and Programs. If you have programs 
in version 1.2 of the system using these modules, you will need to do some 
minor editing to get them running in version 1.3. Here are the changes: 


Syntax and Programs
-------------------

The symbol names 

OName
OType
OTerm
OFormula
OTypeSubst
OTermSubst
OFunctionInd
OPredicateInd
OVarTyping
OProgram
OModulePart
OCondition

have all had the leading O removed.


Each of the predicates

InsDelAxiom
InsDelDelay
InsDelProgramBase
InsDelProgramConstant
InsDelProgramConstructor
InsDelProgramFunction
InsDelProgramPredicate
InsDelProgramProposition
InsDelStatement

now has a separate Insert and Delete form. 


The predicates in Syntax

ConvBindingToTypeSubst
ConvBindingToTermSubst
ConvBindingToVarTyping

are renamed to

BindingToTypeSubst
BindingToTermSubst
BindingToVarTyping


The predicates in Syntax

RenameAllFormulas
RenameAllTerms
RenameAllTypes

have been deleted.  Instead of these, use the predicates

VariantFormulas
VariantTerms
VariantTypes


The predicates in Syntax

OpaqueBaseType
OpaqueConstructorType
OpaqueConstantTerm
OpaqueFunctionTerm
OpaquePropositionAtom
OpaquePredicateAtom
SymbolName

have been deleted.


The predicates in Programs

NonFlounder
EmptyProgram 

have been deleted.


The predicates in Programs

ProgramTypeToString
ProgramTermToString
ProgramFormulaToString

have had the third and fourth arguments reversed. 


The predicate in Programs 

NewProgram

has had its arguments reversed. 


In Programs

TermInProgram has had its 2nd and 3rd arguments reversed.
TermInModule has had its 4th and 5th arguments reversed.



Strings
-------

The predicate

ListIntAsString

is now called 

StringInts 

and its arguments are reversed. 



Theories
--------

Each of the predicates

InsDelTheoryBase
InsDelTheoryConstant
InsDelTheoryConstructor
InsDelTheoryFunction
InsDelTheoryImport
InsDelTheoryPredicate
InsDelTheoryProposition

now has a separate Insert and Delete form


The predicate

NewTheory

has had its arguments reversed. 


The predicates

TheoryTypeToString
TheoryTermToString
TheoryFormulaToString

have had their second and third arguments reversed.
