Goedel Release 1.4 for IBM PC compatibles running Linux:
========================================================

This directory contains the executable binary Goedel system for IBM PC
compatibles running Linux 0.99.15 (or later).  It includes the
executable 'goedel', system files with postfix '.ql' and a SICStus
Prolog supporting directory runtime/Runtime.  The minimum hardware
requirement is a 386 PC with 8 MB memory.


How to use the executable binary Goedel:
=======================================

1. In the runtime directory, there is an executable file called 'goedel'.
   Running this file starts the Goedel system.  It needs to be installed
   in a directory which users can access, for example, /usr/local/bin.

2. The runtime directory has to be moved to somewhere globally
   accessable, for example, /usr/local/lib/goedel.

3. To run 'goedel', users have to set the following environment variables:
      GOEDEL_RUNTIME : the full path to /goedel/runtime
      SP_PATH	     : the same as GOEDEL_RUNTIME

   Note SP_PATH is the environment variable used by SICStus Prolog's runtime
   systems.  Changing it might cause problems to your other SICStus runtime
   systems, if you have a SICStus Prolog which is different from the one with
   which the Goedel runtime system was prepared.

   These environment variables can be set in users' .cshrc/.login files,
   if csh is used, with commands, for example, 
      setenv GOEDEL_RUNTIME /usr/local/lib/goedel/runtime
      setenv SP_PATH /usr/local/lib/goedel/runtime
   
   or in .bashrc/.profile files, if bash is used,
      export GOEDEL_RUNTIME=/usr/local/lib/goedel/runtime
      export SP_PATH=/usr/local/lib/goedel/runtime
